Until the spell ends, the\n          magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire’s space when you cast the\n          spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also\n          make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire’s space for the first time on a turn or\n          ends its turn there.  The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren’t being\n          worn or carried.  The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th\n          level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\n  level-1:\n    slots: 3\n    max-slots: 4\n    spells:\n      - name: Disguise Self\n        range: self\n        duration: 1 hour\n        concentration: false\n        components:\n          - V\n          - S\n        ritual: false\n        casting-time: 1 action\n        desc: >\n          You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your\n          person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You\n          can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change\n          your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.\n          Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.  The changes wrought by this spell fail\n          to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your\n          outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would\n          feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of\n          someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in\n          midair.  To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your\n          appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save\n          DC.\nloot:\n  - name: Grell Poison\n    count: 3\n    desc: Posion scavenged from a grell\n  - name: Gold\n    count: 205\n"),
