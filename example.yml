      - name: Create Bonfire
        range: 60 ft
        duration: Up to 1 minute
        concentration: true
        components:
          - V

        desc: >
          You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the
          magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire’s space when you cast the
          spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also
          make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire’s space for the first time on a turn or
          ends its turn there.  The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren’t being
          worn or carried.  The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th
          level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

    spells:
      - name: Disguise Self
        range: self
        duration: 1 hour
        concentration: false
        components:
          - V
          - S
        ritual: false
        casting-time: 1 action
        desc: >
          You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your
          person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You
          can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change
          your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.
          Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.  The changes wrought by this spell fail
          to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your
          outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would
          feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of
          someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in
          midair.  To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your
          appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
          DC.
